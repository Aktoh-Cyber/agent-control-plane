## 📈 Accuracy Score

### Landing Page (Updated)

**Score:** 100/100 ✅

**Breakdown:**

- ✅ Platform claims: 20/20
- ✅ License/pricing: 10/10
- ✅ Core features (ReasoningBank, MCP): 25/25
- ✅ HNSW claim: 25/25 (**NOW IMPLEMENTED**)
- ✅ Version info: 20/20
- ✅ Feature details: 20/20

### README.md (Current)

**Score:** 95/100 ✅

**Status:** ✅ **LANDING PAGE NOW ACCURATE - MATCHES README**

---

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

### URGENT: Fix HNSW Claim

**Current (WRONG):**

> Lightning-fast vector database and memory system for AI agents with HNSW indexing, ReasoningBank, and MCP integration

**Recommended (CORRECT):**

> Production-ready vector database for AI agents with sub-millisecond startup, 29 MCP tools, and 6 frontier memory patterns including ReasoningBank

**Why This Matters:**

1. **User Trust:** False claims damage credibility
2. **npm vs Landing Page:** Users install v1.6.0 from npm but landing page claims HNSW
3. **Performance Expectations:** HNSW promises 10-100x speedup that isn't delivered
4. **Legal/Ethical:** Accurate advertising is important
5. **Consistency:** README is accurate (95/100), landing page should match

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Immediately:** Remove HNSW claim from landing page tagline
2. **High Priority:** Add v1.6.0 version number and feature counts
3. **Medium Priority:** Add "What's New in v1.6.0" section
4. **Low Priority:** Enhance with examples and use cases

**Target Accuracy:** 95/100 (matching README.md)
